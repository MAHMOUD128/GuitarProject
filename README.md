# Project Story:
## Rick's Guitars
He wants to develop a system to replace the old paper system, so we made a new system and it was considered the first version of it, but it was not with the required efficiency and some customers were lost on Rock because if the customers made a mistake in writing the name, the name of the required guitar does not appear to them, so they think that the guitar is not there, but we developed This system is to appear and force customers to choose from the list that we set by using ## enum, but we faced another problem, which is that it shows him only one guitar, and there may be the same type that the customer wants, but at different prices, and therefore they used ## list.
